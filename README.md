# Heart Disease Prediction using ML/DL Models
The objectives are to build an efficient heart disease prediction model using different machine learning and deep learning algorithms. We aim to leverage a large dataset and rigorous evaluation metrics to achieve high accuracy. The model will provide individual risk scores to enable personalized screening and treatment The project intends to complete several crucial activities to reach this goal. First, it entails gathering and preparing large-scale datasets with pertinent heart health-related information. 
This stage makes that the data is prepared for model training, clean, and well formatted. Next, utilizing the pre-processed data, the algorithms for Gradient Boosting, CNN, decision tree, naÃ¯ve bayes will be put into practice and refined. The goal of the optimization process is to estimate the risk of heart disease with the highest level of accuracy and dependability.
## Dataset Description
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/519/heart+failure+clinical+records

The dataset shapes the 299 instances and 13 features

The dataset includes the following columns:
- age: Age of the patient
- anaemia: 1 if the patient has anaemia, 0 otherwise
- creatinine_phosphokinase: Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood
- diabetes: 1 if the patient has diabetes, 0 otherwise
- ejection_fraction: Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction
- high_blood_pressure: 1 if the patient has hypertension, 0 otherwise
- platelets: Platelet count in the blood
- serum_creatinine: Level of creatinine in the blood
- serum_sodium: Level of sodium in the blood
- sex: 1 for male, 0 for female
- smoking: 1 if the patient smokes, 0 otherwise
- time: Follow-up period (days)
- DEATH_EVENT: 1 if the patient died, 0 otherwise (target variable)
